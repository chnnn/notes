* Book4_Chapter 01 An Introduction to TCP/IP
  
** a brief history
   + initially devices exchange info through a common communication controller 
     - ~network node -> communication controller -> network node~
   + with TCP/IP, devices could function as a network end-point

*** the internet today
   + Toplevel Internet Service Providers(ISPs)
   + Regional Internet Access Providers(IAPs)
   + End-User Nets

** TCP/IP architecture
   #+begin_quote
   TCP/IP is a collection of of protocols that range from application-specific functions like web
browsing down to the low-level networking protocols like IP and TCP.
   #+end_quote

*** OSI reference model 
    + presentation
      - other detailed transmission utility service that applications may or may not use. e.g., data-compression.
      - since it is better to have a dedicated session layer that purely manage sesions, hence separate the optional services into the presentation layer.
    + session
      - responsible for establishing, and later destroying connections between systems, applications, or users. It may receive the request from any higher layer, and then negotiate a connection using the lower layers. Once a connection is established, the layer simply provides an interface for the higher layers to communicate with.
    + transport
      - may provide reliability services usually lacking from the network layer, for basic transmission services.
    + network
      - identify the addresses of systems on the network, and the actual transmission of data between the systems.
      - must be aware of the physical nature of the network, and package the information in a format that can be further transmitted by the data-link layer.
    + data-link
      - must deal with possible physical layer error, either attempting to retransmit or report the failure to the network layer.  
    + physical
      - strict standards for the wiring systems, specifying e.g., voltage, impedance, etc.

*** TCP/IP basic
    + IP <-> OSI-network-layer
    + TCP or UDP <-> OSI-transport-layer, manage connections.
      - the session management is handled by TCP in browsing.
      - TCP/IP does not provide a formal presentation layer service(e.g. data compression) that an application *must* use, but do provide a few presentation layer service(IBM's NetBIOS, Sun's XDR) that an application *may* use.
    + ? data-link layer
      - data-link protocols are specific to wire, e.g. voltage, 
      - Media Access Control(MAC)
      - Data-Link Connection Identifier(DLCI)
      
**** ? nested package and header structure
     + wireshark, 
     + how is segment marked in data-link layer
     + header + data, in each layer.
