* Book4_Chapter 01 An Introduction to TCP/IP
  
** a brief history
   + initially devices exchange info through a common communication controller 
     - ~network node -> communication controller -> network node~
   + with TCP/IP, devices could function as a network end-point

*** the internet today
   + Toplevel Internet Service Providers(ISPs)
   + Regional Internet Access Providers(IAPs)
   + End-User Nets

** TCP/IP architecture
   #+begin_quote
   TCP/IP is a collection of of protocols that range from application-specific functions like web
browsing down to the low-level networking protocols like IP and TCP.
   #+end_quote

*** OSI reference model 
    + presentation
      - other detailed transmission utility service that applications may or may not use. e.g., data-compression.
      - since it is better to have a dedicated session layer that purely manage sesions, hence separate the optional services into the presentation layer.
    + session
      - responsible for establishing, and later destroying connections between systems, applications, or users. It may receive the request from any higher layer, and then negotiate a connection using the lower layers. Once a connection is established, the layer simply provides an interface for the higher layers to communicate with.
    + transport
      - may provide reliability services usually lacking from the network layer, for basic transmission services.
    + network
      - identify the addresses of systems on the network, and the actual transmission of data between the systems.
      - must be aware of the physical nature of the network, and package the information in a format that can be further transmitted by the data-link layer.
    + data-link
      - must deal with possible physical layer error, either attempting to retransmit or report the failure to the network layer.  
    + physical
      - strict standards for the wiring systems, specifying e.g., voltage, impedance, etc.

*** TCP/IP basic
    + IP <-> OSI-network-layer
    + TCP or UDP <-> OSI-transport-layer, manage connections.
      - the session management is handled by TCP in browsing.
      - TCP/IP does not provide a formal presentation layer service(e.g. data compression) that an application *must* use, but do provide a few presentation layer service(IBM's NetBIOS, Sun's XDR) that an application *may* use.
    + ? data-link layer
      - data-link protocols are specific to wire, e.g. voltage, 
      - Media Access Control(MAC)
      - Data-Link Connection Identifier(DLCI)
        
**** Data-Link Services
     + implemented by each physical network, the implemetation might different depending on the physical medium. IP datagram is translated to a format that can be understand and delivered in the physical layer.
       
**** the Internet
     + on each local network, data-link or physical level:
       #+begin_quote
       When an IP-enabled device wants to send data to another IP node, the data-link services on that device convert the IP datagrams into a format usable by the local network medium, and then send the data to the destination system using the addressing and framing mechanisms *dictated by the network*.
       #+end_quote
     + Also, IP assume data packets are unreliable and would get lost.

**** the address resolution protocol(ARP)
     + two IP devices must locate each other's hardware addresses before any data exchange. An protocol applicapable to all physical network topology is needed.
     + ARP(who is .40?) -> Response with Hardware Address(I am .40)
      
**** the Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP)
     + ICMP relies on IP, deliver control message backward.
     + ICMP error message are only sent when there is a detectable problem that is preventing certain packets or datagrams from being delivere due to a specific reason. It indicates that the esnding host should probably stop trying to sent those kinds of datagrams to this specific destination system, or that a different path should be used. 

**** IP datagrams vs. IP packets
     + IP datagram is a more abstract concept, while packets are what been sent in data-link layer:
       #+begin_quote
       IP datagrams get sent as IP packets, which are used to relay the IP data- grams to the destination system, one hop at a time. Although in many cases an IP datagram and an IP packet will be exactly the same, they are conceptually different entities.
       IP datagrams contain whatever data is being sent (and the associated IP headers), while IP packets are used to get the datagram to the destination system (as specified in the IP headers).
       #+end_quote

     + i.e., say: src -> router -> dst, then: src send datagrams to dst, while src send packets to router, in those packets contains datagrams.
       #+begin_quote
       These IP packets are sent using the framing mechanisms defined for the specific network medium in use on the local network, and are sub-ject to network events such as fragmentation or loss. However, the datagram itself will always remain as the original piece of data that was sent by the original sender, regardless of anything that happens to any of the packets that are used to
relay the datagram.
       #+end_quote
     + for example, a 4kb datagram being sent might be too big to fit in a simple frame for transmition in a dial-up access network, hence, the datagram might be split into four IP packets, each of which are sent as individual entities in individual frames. Then on the destination system, once all of the IP packets are received, into the original datagram they will be reassembled and processed.

**** ? nested package and header structure
     + wireshark, 
     + how is segment marked in data-link layer
     + header + data, in each layer.
       
**** ? local loopback network 
     
**** ? routing table, specify router for each destination network.
     + popular protocol popular for private networks
       - Routing Information Protocal(RIP)
       - Open Shrortest Path First(OSPF)
     + those dynamic routing protocols tends to consume a lot of CPU cycles, hence are often ran on routers instead of the host
       - set destination 0.0.0.0 <= default router(e.g., 192.168.100.100), on system boot using protocol such as BOOTP or DHCP, or protocol called Router Discorery 
          
**** ? Route aggregation Q: super route, how to separate local vs internet
     + the routing table method cost lots of resources, is not applicable to Internet.
     + address assignment scheme, separate by physical location, leave routing to ISP, only a few(50,000 routes) super-routes need to be suggested. 

**** datagram independence
     + IP networks treat every individual IP datagram as an independent entity, which means they might take whatever path that the router deems fit when forwarding the datagram.

**** datagram/packet intergrity
     + a *packet* will always be inspected when it arrives a system(including a router) along the delivery path. If corruption or any transient errors is detected, the packet will be destroyed immediately. If a semi-permanent problem, e.g., no rounting table entry for the next destination network is found, is dectected, the IP may also use the Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) to return the error message back to the original sender.
     + ? header checksum: Q: on each packet or each datagram?

**** header checksums
     + IP datagram header
     #+begin_quote
     Every device that receives an IP datagram must examine the IP header and compare that information with the value stored in the header's checksum field.
     The data portion ... is not verified, for (two?) reasons:
     #+end_quote
       1. for efficiency.
       2. the data portion always consists of a higher-level datagram, e.g., TCP/UDP. Since those portocol might also provide error-checking routines, the data portions might be examed later anyway.
          
**** time-to-live
     + the time-to-live field in the IP header.
       #+begin_quote
       Every system that forwards the packet decreases the value of the Time-to-Live field by one, before sending the datagram on. If the Time-To-Live value reaches zero before the datagram gets to its final destination, then the gacket is destroyed.
       The purpose of the Time-to-Live field is to keep datagrams that are caught in an undeliverable loop from tying up network resources. ... This safeguard prevents routing loops from causing network meltdowns.
       ...
       The strict definition of the Time-to-Live field states that the value is a measure of time in seconds, or any forwarding act that took less than one second to perform. However, there are very few Internet routers that require a full second to perform forwarding, so this definition is somewhat misrepresentative. In actual practice, the Time-to-Live value is decremented for every hop, regardless of the actual time required to forward a datagram from one network segment to another.
       #+end_quote
       
     + the default
       #+begin_quote
       The default value for the Time-to-Live field should be set to 64 according to the Assigned Numbers registry([[http://www.iana.org/][IANA]]). In addition, some of the higher-layer protocols also have default Time-to-Live values that they are supposed to use(e.g., 64 for TCP, and 1 for IGMP). These values are really only suggestions, ... .
       #+end_quote
       
**** fragmentation and reassembly
     +
